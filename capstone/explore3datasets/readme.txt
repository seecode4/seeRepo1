For Step 2 of your Capstone, submit a link to your GitHub repository that contains the following:

Three datasets that you have explored — you don't need to link the entire dataset.
Code for how you collected the data, if applicable
The actual dataset — If your dataset is small enough to fit in a CSV, then include it in the repository. 
If it’s a big dataset or has a lot of binary files (graphics, audio), consider using the Git Large File Storage extension.

Juypter notebooks are included for steps to access the three datasets considered.
